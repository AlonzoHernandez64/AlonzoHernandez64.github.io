        <h2> The Standard Format </h2>   
        <p> The Standard format of the Pokemon TCG is the most played format in the whole game. If you want to be competitive, you more often times than not, play the standard format. When it comes to the big tournaments like the Pokemon TCG World Championships (which is held every single year), standard format is... well, the standard. At most big events, this is what is played. The standard format has some unique ruls that set it apart however. Firstly, only a few sets are allowed to be used in standard play. At the time of me writing this, the standard format is Sun and Moon: Team Up (released February of 2019) to now. Any sets after that are legal for tournament play in the format. However, once a year, usually around late August to early September, the format does change. The oldes 4 sets rotate out. This is what players refer to as a Rotation. So one of the key things about the format is to always be cautious about what sets are legal and which sets are not. Other than that, the standard format plays the exact same was as other formats. It is a fun and rewarding way to play the game. A word of caution however... of the 3 main formats showcased, the standard format is one of the most expensive formats to play in. Most cards are new, so having to buy cards and pull the exact card you need can be a pain. However, this is where buying single cards comes into play. While doing this, you can guarentee what cards you are going to get, you will soon realize that buying cards like this can get expensive. Either way you look at it, it's expensive. One of the best cards in the format, Victini Vmax, has a market value of about thirteen dollars. Yes, thirteen dollars for a piece of cardboard, but if you wanna do the best you can, you play the best cards. Which in turn leads me into our next category. </p>

        <h2> The best cards in the standard format </h2>
        <p> While there are a good number of cards in the standard format to choose from, only a very select few rule the roost. In no particular order, these are the best cards that make up that standard format. </p>
