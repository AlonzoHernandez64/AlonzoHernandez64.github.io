        <h2> The Expanded Format </h2>   
        <p> Welcome! This is the expanded format. In my opinion, this is the most fun format of the bunch. In the expanded format, the format consists of cards from the set Black and White (released in 2011) to now. Basically put, every card from the first Black and White expansion, Black and White base set, to the latest set Sword and Shield: Battle Styles, is legal to use. For most players, this can be a bit overwhelming. With over ten years worth of cards to choose from, which do I choose? Well, that is the beauty of the format. The expanded format gives you so much wiggle room for experimentation and trial and error. One moment you may be going up against a Zoroark GX deck, a deck in which you have prepared for and can handle no problem, then the next moment you are against a Keldeo EX deck. A deck in which you don't know the matchup all too well but manage to get a victory. Then you go up against a Wailord deck that plays no energy and their main goal is to stall you out of cards and win by doing nothing. Something in which you are not prepared for. You get the idea. The format allows you to experiment. Be creative about making your deck. Every year, something incredible gets discovered at a regional event that no one has ever thought of. It's always amazing to see what creativity people will put into their expanded decks. You never know what to expect. While most decks will play a standard set of supporter cards, cards you can only play once during your turn, others may opt for very obscure supporter cards. In my opinion, that is what makes the expanded format so fun. It really is a game of seeing what other people are playing and adapt. It's my personal favorite format. However, with so many cards, not everything is sunshine and rainbows. There are a handful of cards that no matter what you do, are NOT legal in the expanded format. The Pokemon company likes us to have fun, but some cards were having a little too much fun. </p>
