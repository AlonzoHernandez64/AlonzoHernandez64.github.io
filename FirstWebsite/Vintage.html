        <h2> Vintage Format </h2>   
        <p> Sometimes, looking at newer cards and having to keep up with other formats may just be too much for people and you just want to play Pokemon cards without having to keep up with the latest cards. Well, look no further than the vintage format. While not a format that the Pokemon Company endorses, the vintage format is a ton of fun to play. If you grew up in the 90's or were around at the time, there is a very good chance you may have had some of these old vintage cards in your collection. They were everywhere. You couldn't escape them. The vintage format consists of 3 sets in total: Base Set, Jungle, and Fossil. That is it. Now you may think that is somewhat limiting, but there are actually a good number of decks to play when it comes to that format. Even today, people are still coming up with modern strategies for a very out of print format. In 2020 Jason Klaczynski, three time world championship winner, hosted a match against another famous icon in the TCG, Kyle Sucevich. Jason said that he wanted to rediscover the old Base through Fossil format and asked if Kyle would be interested. He was and they proceded to play. Jason played the most prominent deck of that time period; haymaker. Kyle didn't own a lot of vintage cards but he threw something together with what he had. Little did he know, that Kyle's top tier deck, stood absolutely no chance at all. This just goes to show you that even silly ideas, can become major game winning strategies. </p>
