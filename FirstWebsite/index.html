        <h2> My History of the Pokemon Trading Card Game </h2>   
        <p> My name is Alonzo Hernandez. I am 24 years old and live in Corsicana Texas. One of my favorite hobbies of all time is playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game. Ever since I was six years old, buying and trading Pokemon cards has been my life. Even to this day, buying Pokemon cards is a modern expense for me. I don't just collect however. I actually do play the game. For most people, this seems interesting as most card collectors consider... well just that; collectors items. While I do find the collecting aspect fun, I am more interested in playing the game. Ever since I was in High School, I learned how to play the game. It was during that time that I started going to in-person events, competing in standard and expanded tournaments. For years now, competing and showing the world what kind of decks I can build and what kind of strategies I can come up with has just been a part of my every day life. Even when I am just sitting around the house, I constantly think about cards. Call it what you will, but I do find it rather enjoyable. Otherwise I wouldn't do it. Makes sense to me. If you look through the navigation bar, you will see different links labled as Standard, Expanded and Vintage. If you click on one of them, it will direct you to that respected format and show you some of the best decks and the strongest cards in the format. Just have fun with it. Maybe this might inspire someone out there. Hope you all enjoy! </p>
