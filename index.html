        <p>
            My name is Alonzo Trinidad Hernandez. I am 25 years old and I live in Corsicana TX. I've lived in the state of Texas my whole life. My hobbies consist of playing video games, repairing vintage game consoles, collecting, and web programing. I have been programing for a little over 2 years and have had very great experience studying through Texas State Technical College. I have learned a lot and am very confident in my abilities to deliver websites for numerous companies to enjoy. I've studied Web Design for a year and have done web programming for a year as well. Furthermore, I am able to organize my work and work proficiently.

        <h3> Where did this all begin? </h3>
        
        <p>
            It all started actually when I was just going to college. I have always been facinated in the world of programming but was never really taught nor did I have any prior knowledge in such a topic. It took me a while to actually begin, but better late than never. Upon starting, I had a bit of a major hurdle to overcome. That being, I have never programmed a day in my life. It was a major struggle. Nothing really made sense. Provided during this time, I was enrolled in the COmputer Programming class. I had yet to discover Web Programming. A semester or two in, I finally took a class in Web Programming. It really did strike a chord with me and I proceeded to change my major over to Web Design and Development and I never looked back. While designing my first website was a very stressful experience, it lead to me understanding more and more about it to where designing websites became fun. The process of planning it all out and making it a reality. The actual design process to me is even more fun than the end result. I've gone on to make a few websites and have really been surprised at how they all have turned out. Along the navigation bar, you will find a section that shows some websites that I have made in my time at TSTC. Of course, some of these were made without any prior knowledge to programming or design, but I gradually see things geting so much better.
